 In recent years, there has been an evident increase in Anemia amongst children in Singapore. As seen in figure 1, a study conducted by World Health Organisation(WHO), there has been a substantial increase in Anemia amongst children under 5 years old in Singapore. Hence, to tackle this growing concern, we decided to investigate the factors affecting children Anemia levels in Nigeria, a country where anemia amongst children is prevalent. By doing so, we hope to be able to gain a better understanding of the factors that affect the level of Anemia amongst children and also create a model to predict the Anemia level of children accurately.
